This repository contains the code for the UnADevs Method: Unbounded Unsupervised Activity Discovery using the Temporal Behaviour Assumption.

The method is based on online clustering, and additinally includes the temporal information of the occuring activities. Therefore, it is able to discover clusters of repating/periodic activities as the occur and additionally keeps track of the time interval of the discovered cluster. This way, the system may prompt the user about the discovered activity with the appropriate time interval and ask for feedback.

The detailed description of the algorithm is in the paper "Unsupervised Online Activity Discovery Using Temporal Behaviour Assumption". [1]

Instructions to run the model are included in the JSI-release notebook.
